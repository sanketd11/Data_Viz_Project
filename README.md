Project Topic: US Visa Applications Visualization

Team : Sanket Deshmukh, Anmol Ahuja, Ashish Gupta


We're handing in total 7 js files in total under the js folder namely :barchart, barchart2, line chart,map ,parallel plot, script and yearwise.

We are also using libraries which are directly being used in the form of CDN and written down in script js.. They are Bootstrap, D3, jquery.

The styles file which is being used for designing is in the css folder where all the styling portion is being implemented to make sure that visualizations looks good.

Data which is being used for the visualizations is in the data folder. In that folder, we have the processed data as well which is a subset of the main data. We did that if in case we want the data having only those attributes which we want to use but later on we realized that we can use the Nest Function for the aggregation.

Theres one pdf namely as Process Book which conveys whatever we are doing in the project step by step. It covers everything what is being required for which this project has been done.

There's one Feedback exercise Pdf which explains what we learnt from the feedback which we got from the other team and most importantly TA as well.

---***NOTE :- WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SCROLLYTELLING BY MANIPULATING LOCATION OF SCROLL BAR IN THE BROWSER WINDOW. PLEASE ADJUST THE BROWSER WINDOW ACCORDINGLY. PLEASE SCROLL A LITTLE INITIAL TO START.
